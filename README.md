# Practice Problems

We have got some [practice problem statements](practice-problem-statements.pdf) to help you get an idea about what to expect in the qualifier round. Go ahead and get your hands dirty to be well prepared and have some tricks up your sleeves before the qualifier round.

The repository also contains skeleton code (in JAVA) to solve practice problems. Implement solution in the method marked with `//TODO: ` without changing the signature of the method.
